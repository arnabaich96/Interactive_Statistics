## Introduction

Statistics help us make sense of data. One of the key concepts in statistics is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). It tells us that no matter what the original population looks like, the average (mean) of multiple samples will tend to follow a normal (bell-shaped) distribution as the number of samples increases. This is crucial because it allows us to make predictions and conclusions about data in a predictable way.

## Simple Random Sampling

### Definition:
Simple random sampling is a sampling technique where each unit in the population has equal chance to appear in the sample. 
It's fundamental for ensuring that our samples are unbiased reflections of the entire population.

Simple random sampling is important because it ensures that the assumptions underlying the Central Limit Theorem hold true. This means the results of our sample analysis are more likely to be accurate and representative of the entire population.

### Example:
Imagine we randomly select 30 students from a school of 300 for a survey on lunch preferences. Each student, whether in the 1st grade or the 12th grade, has an equal chance of being selected.

### Importance of Large Sample Sizes:

Large sample sizes are crucial because they reduce the variability in estimates, leading to more reliable results. For instance, in political polling, a larger sample size can provide a more accurate reflection of the voting population's preferences.
The rule of thumb for the minimum sample size needed to approximate the distribution of the sample mean by a normal distribution depends on the shape of the population distribution:

- For **symmetric** and **bell-shaped** distributions, there is no required sample size.
- For **symmetric** distributions(not bell), a sample size of $15$ is often sufficient.
- For **skewed distributions**, larger sample sizes may be needed. Generally, a sample size of $30$ or more is recommended.
- For **highly skewed** or **heavy-tailed** distributions, sample sizes significantly larger than $50$ may be necessary to ensure the normal approximation is adequate.

## Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the most powerful and well-known results in all of statistics. It states that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the population's distribution, provided the population has a finite variance.

### Derivation of the Central Limit Theorem

Let \(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n\) be a random sample of size \(n\) drawn from a population with mean \(\mu\) and variance \(\sigma^2\). The sample mean \(\bar{X}\) can be expressed as:

$$
\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

By the properties of expectation and variance, we have:

$$
E(\bar{X}) = \mu
\;\;\;\; , \;\;\;\;
Var(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
$$

According to the Central Limit Theorem, as \(n\) approaches infinity, the distribution of the standardized sample means:

$$
Z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \to \text{Normal}(0,1)
$$

approaches a standard normal distribution. The term $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$ is known as **standard error** of sample mean.
