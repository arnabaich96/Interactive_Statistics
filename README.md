# üß† **Interactive Statistical Concepts** üß†

## üéØ **Overview**

This repository contains an interactive statistical document created using *RMarkdown**. The document is designed to help users explore fundamental concepts in statistics through **interactive tools**. These tools allow users to experiment with data, visualize outcomes, and gain insights into various statistical concepts, such as **sampling**, **summary statistics**, **distributions**, **inference**, **ANOVA**, and **Chi-Square tests**.

## üìÇ **Contents**

- **Interactive_Statistics.Rmd**: The main R-Markdown file that contains the code and content for the interactive statistical concepts.
- **Preliminaries.R**: R script for the preliminaries section.
- **Summary_Stat.R**: R script for the summary statistics section.
- **Distributions.R**: R script for the distributions section.
- **Inference.R**: R script for the inference section.
- - **Chi-sq_Test.R**: R script for the Chi-Square test section.
- **ANOVA.R**: R script for the ANOVA section.
- **Regression Analysis**: R script for Regression section.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### üîß **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- **R**: The R programming language.
- **RStudio**: An integrated development environment for R.
- **Markdown**: A scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc.
- **Shiny**: A web application framework for R (if using interactive components).

### üõ† **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnabaich96/Interactive_Statistics.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd interactive_statistics
   ```

3. **Install the required R packages**:
   Open the R console and run the following:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "plotly", "gtsummary", "gt", "tibble", "shinyjs", "shinyalert", "shinyWidgets", "ggplot2", "datasets", "DT", "BSDA"))
   ```

### üìú **Instructions for Rendering an RMarkdown Document to HTML**

#### 1. **Rendering in Bash (Linux/macOS) or Terminal (macOS)**

##### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Terminal:**
   - On macOS, open the Terminal app.
   - On Linux, open your preferred terminal emulator.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where your RMarkdown file is located.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/rmd/file
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/rmd/file` with the actual path to your `.Rmd` file.

3. **Render the Markdown Document to HTML:**
   Use the `Rscript` command to render the RMarkdown file. Here‚Äôs the command:

   ```bash
   Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('Interactive_Statistics.Rmd', output_format = 'html_document')"
   ```

   This command will render the `.Rmd` file and produce an HTML file as output.

4. **Check the Output:**
   The rendered HTML file will be saved in the same directory as the `.Rmd` file.

#### 2. **Rendering in Command Prompt (Windows)**

##### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your RMarkdown file is located.

   ```cmd
   cd C:\path\to\your\rmd\file
   ```

   Replace `C:\path\to\your\rmd\file` with the actual path to your `.Rmd` file.

3. **Render the Markdown Document to HTML:**
   Use the `Rscript` command to render the RMarkdown file:

   ```cmd
   Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('Interactive_Statistics.Rmd', output_format = 'html_document')"
   ```

   This command will render the `.Rmd` file and produce an HTML file as output.

4. **Check the Output:**
   The rendered HTML file will be saved in the same directory as the `.Rmd` file.

## üìå **General Notes for All Platforms:**

- **Dependencies:** Ensure that R, along with the `rmarkdown` package, is installed on your system.
- **LaTeX for PDF:** If you plan to render to PDF, make sure LaTeX is installed on your system.
- **File Path:** Use the correct path syntax for your operating system (forward slashes `/` for Linux/macOS, backslashes `\` for Windows).

## üåê **Deployment**

The document is already deployed to **ShinyApps.io** for interactive exploration. It can be accessed at the following link:
