# What is a Random Variable?

- A **random variable** is like a game of chance.
- Imagine flipping a coin or rolling a die. The result is uncertain, but you know the possible outcomes.
- A random variable represents these outcomes in a structured way.

### Examples:
- **Flipping a coin**: Random variable could be Heads = 1, Tails = 0.
- **Rolling a die**: Random variable could be the number on the die (1 to 6).

# What is a Probability Distribution?

- A **probability distribution** is like a map that tells us how likely each outcome is.
- It shows the probability (chance) of each possible result of a random variable.

### Examples:
- **Flipping a coin**: Both Heads and Tails have a 50% chance, so the probability distribution is:
  - P(Heads = 1) = 0.5
  - P(Tails = 0) = 0.5

- **Rolling a die**: Each number (1 to 6) has an equal chance, so:
  - P(1) = 1/6, P(2) = 1/6, ..., P(6) = 1/6.

# Why is this Important?

- Probability distributions help us understand real-world uncertainty.
- They can be used in all sorts of situations, like predicting weather, stock prices, or the outcome of sports games.

# Fun Example: Weather Prediction

- Imagine youâ€™re predicting rain tomorrow. You can think of it as a random variable:
  - Rain = 1
  - No rain = 0

- Based on historical data, you might say:
  - P(Rain) = 0.3 (30% chance of rain)
  - P(No rain) = 0.7 (70% chance of no rain)

# Conclusion

- Random variables represent uncertain outcomes.
- Probability distributions tell us how likely each outcome is.
- This helps us make better decisions under uncertainty.
